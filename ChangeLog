	* TROUBLESHOOTING: comment concerning namespace cleanup

2007-06-17  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	  bump version and soname for 0.5.0 release

	* libgpod-1.0.pc.in:
	  add glib version and gobject-2.0 to 'Requires:'

2007-06-17  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb.h: libgpod will not change the values for sort_artist.
	  Furthermore, libgpod reads the stored values of
	  sort_artist/_album... from the iTunesDB and makes them available
	  through the Itdb_Track structure. Applications should modify
	  these values along with the corresponding artist/album... fields
	  if a particular sort order is required.

	* src/itdb.h: corrected description for "BPM" (beats per minute)

2007-06-14  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/es.po: new version updated by Alejandro Lamas Daviña.

2007-06-11  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/ja.po
	  po/sv.po
	  po/it.po: Changed license to "same as gtkpod" to "same as
	  libgpod" after consulting with translators. Waiting for response
	  from the Hebrew and Spanish translators.

2007-06-02  Daniele Forsi <dforsi at users.sourceforge.net>

        * po/it.po: updated Italian translation

2007-05-27  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/db-artwork-parser.c (parse_mhba): non-zero terminated
	  string was copied using g_strdup() instead of g_strndup(). This
	  affected album names of the Photo Database.

	  src/db-artwork-writer.c (write_mhod_type_1): convert 'type' as
	  16 bit integer, not 32 bit integer. Potential problem on
	  non-standard endian system (iPod side).

	  src/db-itunes-parser.h: '#if 0' unused structure to avoid
	  confusion.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c (itdb_photodb_parse): return a valid
	  photodb structure including the main Photo Library album if no
	  database existed, analogous to itdb_photodb_create(). Without
	  this the test-photos script won't work as expected and other
	  applications also would have to add extra checks for presence of
	  the main Photo Libarary.

2007-05-30  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

        * bindings/python/tests/resources/iTunes/iTunesDB.ext
          docs/reference/libgpod-docs.xml
          docs/reference/tmpl/photodb.sgml
          m4/python.m4:
          change CVS references and links to SVN

2007-05-27  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-artwork-parser.c
	  src/db-artwork-writer.c
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_private.h:
	  Fixed segfault when parsing photo databases introduced by the
	  new handling of timestamps (all timestamps exported are
	  host-local time_t).
	  itdb_time_time_t_to_mac() and itdb_time_mac_to_time_t() were
	  renamed to device_*() and take a pointer to an Itdb_Device
	  instead of a pointer to an Itdb_iTunesDB structure as the latter
	  does not exist in case of photo databases. All references to
	  those two functions were changed accordingly and the functions
	  themselves were moved from itdb_itunesdb.c to itdb_device.c.

2007-05-23  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (get_playlist): fix a potential crasher
	  (Raymond Walsh)

2007-05-19  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (playcounts_init): C&P error stat'ing the
	  wrong file. Thanks to Raymond Walsh.

	* src/itdb_device.c (itdb_set_sysinfo): Corrected comment. Thanks
	  to Daniele Forsi.

2007-05-17  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h: warning about adding string fields
	  src/itdb_track_duplicate: duplicate new string fields
	  (sort_*). Thanks to Raymond Walsh.

2007-05-10  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * TROUBLESHOOTING: added a note about the 'padding[]'
	  incompatibility with older versions of gcc.

2007-05-12  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

2007-05-10  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/itdb_itunesdb.c: remove non-sense check (itdb != NULL) when
	  itdb can never be NULL. Thanks to Raymond Walsh.

2007-05-07  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/itdb_artwork.c
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  tests/test-photos.c:
	  Corrected some typos. Thanks to Daniele Forsi.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c:
	  Fix for 64 bit systems: don't show "last played" data as played
	  in the last century... Thanks to Christophe.

2007-05-06  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_private.h
	  src/itdb.h:
	  New API functions to facilitate copying to the iPod in a
	  background thread and implementation of own copying code.

	  itdb_cp_get_dest_filename(): obtain a valid filename on the iPod
	  to where a track can be copied. This function can be used in a
	  thread-safe way.

	  itdb_cp_finalize(): to be called after the track was
	  copied to the iPod to update some fields in the Itdb_Track
	  structure. This function can also be used in a thread-safe way.

	  You can use the already existing function itdb_cp() to copy a
	  track to the iPod and itdb_cp_track_to_ipod() remains available
	  unchanged in functionality.

2007-05-01  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_cp_track_to_ipod): removed static
	  variable "dir_num" which was initialized once and cycled through
	  for each track transfered. This doesn't seem right since
	  different iPods with different number of music directories may
	  be connected at the same time, and itdb_cp_track_to_ipod() may
	  be called for different iTunesDBs at the same in in a threaded
	  environment. Since there is no inherent value in cycling through
	  the directories, a random directory is selected each time.

2007-04-30  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb (itdb_parse_internal): fixed compile warning
	  (thanks to Daniele Forsi).

	* tests/test-ls.c (display_recently_played): fixed compile warning
	  (thanks to Daniele Forsi).

	* tests/get-timezone.c: added to CVS (thanks to Daniele Forsi).

	* src/itdb_playlist.c (compMostOftenPlayed, compLeastOftenPlayed):
	  compaered time_added instead of playcount (thanks to Daniele
	  Forsi).

2007-04-28  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h: added padding to exported structures so new entries
	  can be added without loosing backward run-time compatibility.

	* docs/reference/tmpl/track.sgml
	  src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_track.c: Added the following fields to Itdb_Track:

	  sort_artist
	  sort_title
	  sort_album
	  sort_albumartist
	  sort_composer
	  sort_tvshow

	  These fields can (theoretically) be used to force a certain sort
	  order on the iPod when displaying by artist, album...

	  Even though these fields are present in the iTunesDB, they are
	  discarded when reading the iTunesDB and applications must always
	  set them before writing the iTunesDB again. This is to avoid
	  that the fields 'artist' and 'sort_artist' accidentially get out
	  of sync.

	  libgpod will automatically create a sort_artist key for you if
	  artist is of the type 'The Artist' and sort_artist is not
	  set. The sort key used in that case is 'Artist, The' (followed
	  by five time 0x01), even though sort_artist itself will not be
	  touched.

	  docs/reference/libgpod-sections.txt
	  docs/reference/tmpl/libgpod-unused.sgml
	  docs/reference/tmpl/smart-playlists.sgml:

	  Namespace cleanup. Applications supporting smart playlists will
	  have to be adapted. The following changes were implemented to
	  make sure all exported symbols start with ITDB or Itdb:
 
 	  structs:
 	      SPLPref -> Itdb_SPLPref
 	      SPLRules -> Itdb_SPLRules
 	      SPLRule -> Itdb_SPLRule
 	      SPL_* -> ITDB_SPL_*

 	      LIMITSORT_* -> ITDB_LIMITSORT_*
 	      SPLMATCH_* -> ITDB_SPLMATCH_*
 	      SPLACTION_* -> ITDB_SPLACTION_*

 	      enum ItdbLimitType (new)
 	      enum ItdbLimitSort (new)

	  src/itdb_device.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_private.h
	  tests/Makefile.am:

	  Christophe's patch for automatic correction of timestamps
	  depending on which timezone the iPod is set to.

	  ATTENTION DEVELOPERS: as a consequence all exported timestamps
	  are no longer guint32 mac-type timestamps but standard time_t
	  timestamps. This also includes the 64 bit timestamps in smart
	  playlists. The following functions are therefore no longer
	  needed and are deprecated:

	  itdb_time_mac_to_host(), itdb_time_host_to_mac(): simply return
	  the argument without changing it. Argument and return value are
	  now both of type 'time_t'.

	  itunesdb_time_get_mac_time(): returns the seconds passed since
	  Epoch in seconds and is equivalent to time(NULL).

	  These functions may be removed in a future version of
	  libgpod. Programs linking to libgpod may need to be changed
	  slightly if they made any assumptions on the type of timestamps
	  used. This should be obvious through compile-time warnings.

	  tests/test-ls.c: print a list of recently played tracks.


2007-04-15  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

	* bindings/python/ipod.py: use the mac-style path for
	  filename_ipod in the extended info file, like gtkpod does

2007-04-14  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_device.c: add itdb_device_supports_artwork and
	idb_device_supports_photo functions
	* docs/reference/tmpl/device.sgml: update api doc
	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: don't try to write artwork database if the iPod
	model doesn't support artwork.

2007-04-08  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h: changed 'gchar *chapterdata' to 'gpointer
	  chapterdata' with note that chapterdata is not yet supported.

	* src/itdb_track.c (itdb_track_duplicate): arrange the strings in
	  the same order as in Itdb_Track for easier error-checking.

2007-03-26  Nicholas Piper  <nicholas at users.sourceforge.net>

	* bindings/python/Makefile.am
	  bindings/python/tests/Makefile.am
	  bindings/python/tests/tests.py: Causes tests to run with the

	  version (Todd Zullinger)

2007-03-26  Nicholas Piper  <nicholas at users.sourceforge.net>

	* bindings/python/gpod.i.in: Add basic PhotoDB reading facility

2007-03-25  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: streamline MHOD52 patch (remove mk_mhod52()
	  and let mk_mhod() handle the sorting of mhod52 directly).

2007-03-23  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: Write out MHOD52 hunks after master
	  playlist. This speeds up the iPod interface when browsing titles
	  or albums etc. because the iPod won't have to sort through the
	  track list.

2007-03-22  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (write_playlist): corrected what is written
	  into the mhyp header according to the iTunesDB wiki (mhod count /
	  libmhod count)

2007-03-21  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c (itdb_artwork_remove_thumbnail): memory used
	  by thumbnail to be removed will be freed now. ATTENTION: this
	  changes the previous API description that stated that the
	  thumbnail will not be freed. This behaviour was inconsistent
	  with all other _remove functions in libgpod and caused a memory
	  hole.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_cp_track_to_ipod): cast filename
	  extension to lowercase because some people reported new iPod
	  models choking on filenames with uppercase extensions like
	  test.MP3. Not sure if it helps, though.

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_artwork.c
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c
	  src/itdb_track.c
	  src/ithumb-writer.c:
	  Added new API functions: itdb_photodb_add_photo_from_pixbuf
	  function(), itdb_track_set_thumbnails_from_pixbuf() and
	  itdb_artwork_add_thumbnail_from_pixbuf(). Thanks to Christophe
	  Fergeau.

	* docs/reference/libgpod-sections.txt: added descriptions by
	  Christophe Fergeau.
	
2007-03-02  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

	* bindings/Makefile.am: only descend into the python subdir if

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_playlist.c: introduced splft_binary_and as separate
	  field type as this will simplify handling in applications.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (get_mhod, mk_mhod): replaced
          if()... with a switch()... to catch changes made to
          SPLFieldType more easily.

	* src/itdb.h: introduced Itdb_Mediatype enum.

2007-02-24  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-itunes-parser.h
	  src/artwork-writer.c: Set unknown2 of mhfd header to 2 instead
	  of 1, otherwise iTunes7 wipes the ArtworkDB.

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_playlist.c:
	  Updated smart playlist handling to recognize album artist, tv
	  show, last skipped, season number, skipcount and video kind
	  fields.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (get_mhod): don't skip unknown action types
	  in smart rules to avoid writing illegal smart playlist rules
	  corrupting the iTunesDB in the process.

2007-01-06  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am: cleanup

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c: renamed unk156 to skipcount and unk160 to
	  last_skipped.
	  Added unk244, gapless_data, unk252, gapless_track_flag,
	  gapless_album_flag, recent_skipcount.
	  Added handling of skipcount and last_skipped to playount file
	  handling.

	* src/itdb_private.h: added skipcount and last_skipped to struct
	  playcount.

2007-01-04  Todd Zullinger <tmzullinger at users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac
	  gnome-autogen.sh
	  bindings/python/Makefile.am
	  docs/reference/libgpod-overrides.txt
	  docs/reference/Makefile.am: fix make distcheck, minor automake
	  cleanups.

	* bindings/python/gpod.i
	  bindings/python/gpod.i.in: rename gpod.i -> gpod.i.in.  it is now
	  generated by autoconf.

2006-11-26  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ithumb-writer.c (ithumb_writer_write_thumbnail): handle
	  corrupted image data in a way that does not crash libgpod nor
	  causes the ArtworkDB or PhotoDB to be corrupted. Currently a
	  completely red pixmap is created as a substitute. Somewhat more
	  artistic than I am may want to create a "corrupted image data"
	  pixmap we can imbed into the code.

	* src/itdb_artwork.c (itdb_thumb_get_gdk_pixbuf): fix failed
	  assertion when image data is illegal.

2006-11-24  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c (itdb_photodb_add_photo,
	  itdb_photodb_add_photo_from_data,
	  itdb_photodb_photoalbum_add_photo): add 'position' where photo
	  should be inserted.

	* tests/test-photos.c: implemented new API (append at the end).

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c: removed mhodcount and libmhodcount from
	  Itdb_Playlist as these are only used internally and reset during
	  syncing.

2006-11-23  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* When adding photos to the iPod the user may or may not want to
	  rotate the picture shown on the iPod screen, for example
	  deending on EXIF rotation value. This can now be achieved by
	  passing a new parameter 'rotation' to itdb_photodb_add_photo()
	  or itdb_photodb_add_photo_from_data(). (Valid values: 0, 90, 180,
	  270, rotation is counter-clockwise). These two functions now
	  also accept a GError pointer. As a consequence Itdb_Thumb had to
	  be extended with a field for the rotation value and
	  itdb_artwork_add_thumbnail have been extended to accept
	  @rotation and @error as well.

	  The actual rotation is carried out in
	  ithumb-writer.c/ithumb_writer_write_thumbnail() using
	  gdk_pixbuf_rotate_simple() and require gdk-pixbuf V2.6 or
	  higher.

	  In contrast, itdb_track_set_thumbnails() and
	  itdb_track_set_thumbnails_from_data have been left unchanged,
	  even though they could be extended to accept @rotation and
	  @error easily. Please let me know if this is wanted.

	* configure.ac
	  src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_artwork.c
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c
	  src/itdb_track.c
	  src/ithumb-writer.c: implemented changes outlined above.

	* tests/test-photos.c: added @rotation and @error to the
	  itdb_photodb_add_photo() call.

2006-11-12  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* ithumb-writer.c (itdb_write_ithumb_files):
	  ITDB_THUMB_PHOTO_TV_SCREEN type thumbnails were not "rearranged"
	  (i.e. deleted photos were not removed).

	  (ipod_image_get_ithmb_filename, ithmb_writer_write_thumbnail):
	  changed "F%u04_%d.ithmb" to "F%d_%d.ithmb" as this format string
	  is used by the iPod.

	  NEW: start new thumbnail file F%d_2/3/4... if the size of the
	  current thumbnail file is larger than ITHUMB_MAX_SIZE (currently
	  500 MB). Existing thumbnail files with a length larger than this
	  will NOT be truncated. Patches are welcome (probably add code at
	  the end of ithumb_rearrange_thumbnail_file()) :-) 

	* itdb_artwork.c: added support for UYVY format for iPod Video and
	  iPod Photo TV output. Code adapted from the GPixPod project.

	  (itdb_thumb_get_byteorder): return the byte order for the
	  current thumbnail (internal function).

	* itdb_device.[hc]: added thumbnail storage format to the
	  Itdb_ArtworkFormat image information. Currently the following
	  are defined:
	    THUMB_FORMAT_UYVY
	    THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_LE
	    THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_BE
	    THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_BE_90
	    THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_LE_90
	  THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_LE_90 does not appear to be used by any iPod
	  model. THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_BE_90 is used for full screen iPod
	  Photo photos but currently is handeled the same as
	  THUMB_FORMAT_RGB565_BE pending input from iPod Photo users.

	* ithumb-writer.c: added support for UYVY format for iPod Video and
	  iPod Photo TV output. Code adapted from the GPixPod project.

2006-11-11  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: Itdb_Artwork:
	  - added unk028, unk036 and rating
	  - added digitized_data timestamp
	  - changed creation_date from gint32 to guint32

	* db-itunes-parser.h:
	  db-artwork-debug.c: MhiiHeader:
	  - renamed unknown5 to rating
	  - renamed digitised_date to digitized_date for conformity

	* db-artwork-writer.c (write_mhli): sanity check to avoid access
	  of NULL pointer.
	  (write_mhii): write unk028, rating, unk036, digitized_data

	* db-artwork_parser.c (parse_mhii):
	  - parse unk028, rating, unk036, digitized data.
	  - unified reading of DB_TYPE_PHOTO and DB_TYPE_ITUNES, got rid
	    of parse_mhod() and parse_mhni().


	
2006-11-08  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h:
	  itdb_itunesdb.c:
	  itdb_track.c:
	  renamed some formerly unknown Itdb_Track entries and added
	  comments:
	   - unk184->pregap
	   - samplecount: guint32 -> guint64.
	   - unk192->(removed)
	   - unk200->postgap
	   - unk208->mediatype
	   - unk212->season_nr
	   - unk216->episode_nr

2006-10-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/itdb_photoalbum.c: fixed typo (Libarary -> Library).

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: new soname versioning
	  scheme. Thanks to Todd Zullinger and Frank Lichtenheld.

2006-10-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	Major rework of picture support.
	
	* src/db-artwork-parser.c, src/db-artwork-writer.c, src/itdb.h,
	  src/db-itunes-parser.h: renamed 'master' to 'album_type' in
	  MhbaHeader and Itdb_PhotoAlbum.

	* src/db-artwork-parser.c, src/db-artwork-writer.c,
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c: Itdb_Photoalbum->members are now pointers
	  to the corresponding Itdb_Artwork instead of image_ids.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: album_ids and image_ids are set just
	  before writing the PhotoDB in itdb_photodb_write().

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: new interface, basically use as follows:

	  itdb_photodb_parse():
	    Read an existing PhotoDB.

          itdb_photodb_create():
            Create a new Itdb_PhotoDB structure. The Photo Library Album is
	    (first album) is created automatically.

          itdb_photodb_add_photo(), itdb_photodb_add_photo_from_data():
	    Add a photo to the PhotoDB (from file or from a chunk of
	    memory). It is automatically added to the Photo Library Album
	    (first album), which is created if it does not exist already.

	  itdb_photodb_photoalbum_craete():
	    Create and add a new photoalbum.

	  itdb_photodb_photoalbum_add_photo():
	    Add a photo (Itdb_Artwork) to an existing photoalbum.

	  itdb_photodb_photoalbum_remove():
	    Remove an existing photoalbum. Pictures can be kept in the
	    Photo Library or automatically removed as well.

	  itdb_photodb_remove_photo():
	    Remove a photo either from a photoalbum or completely from the
	    database.

	  itdb_photodb_write():
	    Write out your PhotoDB.

	  itdb_photodb_free():
	    Free all memory taken by the PhotoDB.

	  itdb_photodb_photoalbum_by_name():
	    Find the first photoalbum with a given name.

        * src/itdb_playlist.c (itdb_playlist_add, itdb_playlist_add_track):
	  src/itdb_track.c (itdb_track_add): simplify code by using
	  g_list_insert().

	* tests/test-photos.c: change to new interface, add new commands
	  'list' to list photo IDs in the database, 'remove' to remove IDs
	  from an album or the iPod, or remove entire photoalbums from the
	  iPod.

	* src/db-itunes-parser.h: added comments to _MhbaHeader definition.

	Added additional functionality for photo albums

	* src/db-artwork-parser.c
	  src/db-artwork-writer.c
	  src/db-itunes-parser.c:
	  src/itdb.h: added additional fields to MhbaHeader and
	  Itdb_PhotoAlbum (playmusic, repeat, random, show_titles,
	  transition_direction, slide duration, transition_duration,
	  unk024, unk028, unk044, unk048, song_id. These fields are read
	  and written from the PhotoDB now. Also corrected error for
	  "album type" which was read and written as int32 even though it
	  was a int8. Removed num_images from Itdb_PhotoAlbum -- instead
	  count images at time of writing.
	
2006-10-02  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am
	  tests/test-init-ipod.c: fix compilation error when building with
	  --disable-gdk-pixbuf. Thanks to David Philippi and Christophe
	  Fergeau.

	* src/itdb.h: explain 'checked' field in Itdb_Track declaration

	* src/itdb_playlist.c (itdb_spl_update): in SPLs with 'match
	  checked tracks only" set, all unchecked tracks were matched.

2006-09-21  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: time_added and time_modified where
	  interchanged.

	* src/itdb_device.c: changed number of directories for 6G 8GB iPod
	  Nano to 14 after user report.

	* src/ithumb-writer.c: removed re-using of thumbnail data in order
	  to avoid incompatibility with iTunes (even though our way was
	  more efficient...)
	
2006-09-18  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_artwork.c: added itdb_artwork_add_thumbnail_from_data().

	  retreive thumbnail from raw data instead of file.

	* src/ithumb-writer.c (ithumb_writer_write_thumbnail): added
	  support to write thumbnail from raw data instead of file.

2006-09-17  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_device.c: added definitions for new sixth generation
	  iPod Videos, iPod Nanos and iPod Shuffle.

2006-08-21  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/test-ls.c: added option to list contents of local
	  repository and specified playlist. Thanks to Richard Hyde for
	  the patch.

2006-08-18  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c (ipod_buffer_grow_file): printf(3) type
	  warnings caused compile error with FreeBSD 6.0-stable/GCC
	  3.4.4. Thanks to Mike Heffner for the patch.

2006-07-08  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	  mobile phones. Thanks to Rached Ben Mustapha for the patch.

2006-06-24  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb.h:
	  Added itdb_get_itunessd_path ().
	  itdb_init_ipod() will no longer overwrite existing iTunesDB and
	  iTunesSD.

2006-06-10  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_device.c (itdb_device_get_ipod_info): compare more than
	  4 characters of iPod model if the stored model number is more
	  than 4 characters long.

2006-06-07  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_device.c:
	  Added itdb_device_write_sysinfo() and itdb_device_set_sysinfo().

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_create_directories):
	  Use functions introduced above.

	  (itdb_write): Write SynsInfo file when writing the iTunesDB if

2006-06-05  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/db-artwork-parser.h
	  src/db-artwork-parserc (ipod_supports_cover_art): made
	  available G_GNUC_INTERNAL.
	  Added ipod_supports_photos().

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_create_directories):
	  Create Photos directory.

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  Rename itdb_info_get_ipod_model_name() ->
	         itdb_info_get_ipod_model_name_string()
		 itdb_info_get_ipod_generation_name() ->
		 itdb_info_get_ipod_generation_string()

        * src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_create_directories): add space after
	  ":" when writing SysInfo file, only write SysInfo file if
	  model_number was given, write original model number, not
	  abbreviated model number from info->model_number.

2006-06-04  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-image-parser.c
	  src/itdb_artwork.c
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c
	  src/itdb_track.c
	  src/ithumb-writer.c: Phased out private
	  IPOD_COVER_SMALL... enum in favor of identical public enum
	  "ItdbThumbType" ITDB_THUMB_COVER_SMALL...

	* src/db-image-parser.c (ipod_image_new_from_mhni):
	  Accept all thumbnail types we know about (i.e. type != -1).

	* src/db-artwork-debug.h
	  src/db-artwork-parser.h
	  src/db-image-parser.h
	  src/db-parse-context.h
	  src/glib-compat.h
	  src/itdb_endianness.h: Added CVS "$Id:" line, added copyright
	  notices where missing, added explanations to itdb_endianess.h
	  ;-)

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_track.c
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_device.h
	  Made naming consistent and suitable for export:
	    Itdb_IpodModel -> Itdb_IpodInfo
	    ipod_model_table -> ipod_info_table
	    itdb_device_get_model_info() -> itdb_device_get_ipod_info()
	    MODEL_TYPE_... -> ITDB_IPOD_MODEL_...
	    nth_GENERATION -> ITDB_IPOD_GENERATION_nth

	  Exported Itdb_IpodModel, Itdb_IpodGeneration, Itdb_IpodInfo,
	  itdb_device_get_ipod_info().

	* src/itdb_device.c: new API:
	  itdb_info_get_ipod_info_table(),
	  itdb_info_get_ipod_model_name()

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_artwork.c:
	  Removed unused field ->type in Itdb_Artwork and corresponding
	  enum ItdbArtworkType.

2006-06-03  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c (itdb_thumb_get_gdk_pixbuf): handle thumbnail
	  padding correctly -- who would have thought that iTunes
	  indicates _negative_ padding at times... Please use the
	  test-photos program to check out whether or not your photos show
	  up correctly without black bars or funny colors.

        * src/db-artwork-writer.c
	  src/db-image-parser.c
	  src/itdb.h
	  src/ithumb-writer.c: Hopefully do padding right:

	   - read padding fields from mhni header and store them with
	     each thumbnail 
	   - calculate padding for PhotoDB only (padding for iTunesDB
	     Artwork does not seem to be necessary)
	   - include the padding into the total width/height

	   It seems to work well on my iPod Nano -- feedback appreciated.

	* tests/test-photos.c: added possibility to dump all photos into
	  a directory:

	  tests/test-photos dump <mountpoint> <output_dir>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c: changed byte order for full screen iPod
	  Nanos. 

2006-06-01  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c (write_mhni): fix segfault caused by
	  wrong access of enum inside Itdb_DB

	* src/itdb.h:

	  moved Itdb_DB to private part.

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itdb_private.h:
	  src/itdb_itunesdb:
	  New: db_get_itunesdb(), db_get_photodb()

	  src/db-parse-context.h
	  src/itdb_endianness.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/ithumb-writer.c:
	  Remove all direct access to Itdb_DB->db. enum

2006-05-31  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	  m4/python: check for eyeD3 (Todd Zullinger)

2006-05-30  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_create_directories): applied
	  Christophe's cleanup-patch, 'normalized' indenting. Function
	  made 'static'.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_init_ipod): fixed segfault.

	* m4/python: default configure option --with_python to 'yes'
	  (Nicholas Piper)

	***** merged photo-support branch back to MAIN. branch is tagged
	      photo-support-merged_00

2006-05-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * tests/test-photos.c: removed unneeded #include.

	* configure.ac: print configuration summary -- thanks to Todd
	  Zullinger

	* itdb.h:
	  itdb_itunesdb.c:
	  added itdb_init_ipod() -- thanks to P.G. Richardson.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_write_file): only write artwork if
	  supported by the iPod -- thanks to P.G. Richardson.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c:
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  src/itdb_playlist.c:
	
	  fixed some comments so the doc subsystem won't complain.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	  tests/test-init-ipod.c

	  added new test for itdb_init_ipod(). The test also demonstrates
	  how to 'autodetect' the iPod model number.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  src/ithumb-writer.c:
	  src/itdb_artwork.c:
	  src/itdb.h:
	  src/db-itunes-parser.h:
	  src/db-artwork-writer.c:
	  src/db-artwork-parser.c:
	  src/db-artwork-debug.c:

	  Patch by Michael McLellan:
	  
	  Doesn't automatically make the first photoalbum the
	  'master'. However, if a master already exists it will remain the
	  master.

	  Sets the creation date of a new image to the modification time
	  of the image file.

	  Centers new images.

	  Introduces itdb_photodb_remove_photo().

	
2006-05-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itunesdb.c: (Itdb_Track)
	      flag2 -> skip_when_shuffling
	      flag3 -> remember_playback_position

	* src/itunesdb.c: playlist flags 1,2,3 were not read correctly.

2006-05-28  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-parse-context.c (db_parse_context_new_from_file):
	  Detect endianess if not already set.

	* src/itdb_device.c (itdb_device_autodetect_endianess): try
	  reading the first for bytes of iTunesDB, ArtworkDB or Photos
	  Database in order to reliably detect the endianess of the
	  connected iPod.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: (itdb_photodb_parse): will fail again if
	  no photos dir is available.

	* tests/test-photos.c: takes into consideration the possibility
	  that an iPod does not have a Photos Database and creates a new
	  one in that case. (I think it's safer that way -- the
	  application is forced to 'think' about the fact that no database
	  is available and either warn the user or create one. If
	  itdb_photodb_parse() simply returns an empty database in case
	  none could be found, the application might not become aware of
	  the fact.)

	* renamed itdb_get_mountpoint_photo to
	  itdb_photodb_get_mountpoint.

	* tests/test-photos.c: added g_error_free()

	* src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_device.h: added number of musicdirs (Fnn dirs) to the
	  model descriptions. The exact number seems to be version
	  dependent. Therefore, the numbers here represent a mixture of
	  reported values and common sense.

2006-05-27  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: itdb_photodb_parse() would fail if no
	  photos dir is available. Quick fix for now (I mean, why
	  SHOULDN'T it fail if no photos dir is available??).

2006-05-26  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  src/itdb_artwork.c:
	  Added userdata/usertype fields to Itdb_PhotoDB, Itdb_PhotoAlbum,
	  Itdb_Artwork.

2006-05-25  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * Slight cleanup, make PhotoDB API more consistent with iTunesDB
	  API:

	* src/db-artwork-parser.h: declared ipod_write_photo_db() as
	  G_GNUC_INTERNAL

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c (ipod_write_photo_db for non-gdk):
	  Itdb_iTunesDB -> Itdb_PhotoDB

	* src/itdb.h:
	  Itdb_ItunesDB: removed photoalbums and photos.
	  renamed:
	  	 itdb_parse_photo -> itdb_photodb_parse
		 itdb_add_photo_to_photoalbum -> itdb_photodb_add_photo
		 itdb_create_new_photoalbum -> itdb_photodb_photoalbum_new
		 itdb_free_photodb -> itdb_photodb_free
		 itdb_write_photo_db -> itdb_photodb_write
	  new:   itdb_photodb_new()

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_parse_photo, itdb_get_photos_dir,
	  itdb_get_photodb_path, itdb_get_photos_thumb_dir): moved to
	  itdb_photoalbum.c

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  new:   error_no_photos_dir, itdb_photodb_new, itdb_photodb_write
	  moved: itdb_get_photos_dir, itdb_get_photodb_path,
	         itdb_get_photos_thumb_dir
	  rewrote: 
	         itdb_photodb_parse
	  (itdb_photodb_free): free device struct as well.

	* tests/test-photos.c: change to new API.

	* src/itdb.h: applied Christophe's patch to fix compile time
	  error.

	* po/sv.po: updated Swedish translation (thanks to Stefan

2006-05-07  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* Created new branch "photo-support" for testing of photo
	  support. Comes complete with a test program to add photos to
	  your iPod. Works great for me -- thanks to Mikey!

	  --- 2006-05-30: merged back to MAIN.

2006-05-06  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * tests/Makefile.am: removed 'test-rebuild-db' from
	  'noinst_PROGRAM' declaration (bug reported by Jens
	  Taprogge). 'test-rebuild-db' is only added when the taglib is
	  detected.

2006-04-12  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* tests/test-rebuild-db.cc: forgot to propagate a GError

2006-04-10  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	content 
	* tests/test-rebuild-db.cc: new test program which looks for mp3 files

	depending on taglib's availability)
	* configure.ac:
	* tests/Makefile.am: build system changes to accomodate the 2 new test
	programs
	
2006-04-10  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

2006-04-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* configure.ac: generate Makefile for bindings/python/examples

2006-04-03  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: flag1 -> has_artwork

	* itdb_track.c: (itdb_track_set_thumbnails,
	  itdb_remove_thumbnails) set has_artwork flag correctly.

2006-04-01  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: unk178 -> mark_unplayed

	* itdb_itunesdb.c: reset the mark_unplayed flag when playcount is
	  detected.

2006-03-31  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	  maintains the gtkpod translation as well.

2006-03-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * itunesdb.c: set filetype identifier when transfering track to
	  the iPod.

2006-03-24  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	Alpha version of reversed-endian Artwork writing. Status: iTunesDB
	can be written and is accepted on mobile phones, ArtworkDB can be
	read and be written as well, but newly added artwork will not yet
	display.

	* itdb.h: adjusted a couple of field lengths (4 byte -> 2 byte or
	  even 1 byte) to address endian issues.

2006-03-18  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (mk_mhod): fixed bug when writing podcast urls.

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_write_file): move endianess autodetection
	  to a place before calling ipod_write_artwork_db().

2006-03-17  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb_device.[ch]: rewrote ipod-device.c, removed all hal-code,
	  removed all code irrelevant to writing the iTunesDB and
	  ArtworkDB.

	* autodetect iControl directory now also works for ArtworkDB.

	* db-artwork-parser.c (ipod_db_get_artwork_db_path): create
	  Artwork directory if not already present.

	* itdb.h: Itdb_iTunesDB: moved mountpoint and musicdirs into
	  private Itdb_Device. Use itdb_set_mountpoint() and
	  itdb_get_mountpoint() to access the mountpoint.

	* simplified some code by using itdb_get_path() instead of
	  itdb_resolve_path().

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_get_path): fixed bug.

2006-03-12  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * itdb.h, itdb_itunesdb.c: added functions for autodetection of
	  iControl directory (currently either <mp>/iPod_Control or
	  <mp>/iTunes/iTunes_Control): itdb_get_control_dir() and
	  itdb_get_itunes_dir()

2006-02-12  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: added movie_flag and lyrics_flag to Itdb_Track

	* itdb.h, itdb_itunesdb.c, itdb_private.h: added support for
	  mobile phone reversed-endian iTunesDB. Please note that you have
	  to rename the folder iTunes_Control to iPod_Control manually. to
	  write reversed-endian files, itdb->reversed must be set to
	  TRUE. When reading an iTunesDB the endianess is detected
	  automatically and itdb->reversed set appropriately.  Only the
	  inversed iTunesDBs, 'Play Counts', and OTG playlist files are
	  read yet. The ArtworkDB and thumbnail files cannot be parsed
	  yet.

2006-02-04  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* ipod-device.c: added entries for iPod Nano 1 GB black and white
	  (thanks to Leonhard Gruenschlos)

	  a temporary workaround until a propoer solution can be
	  implemented.

	* db-itunes-parser.h: replaced the #pragma pack(4) with an
	  'packed' attribute on _MhiiHeader only.

2006-02-28  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* ipod-device.c: (ipod_device_set_property): fixed possible

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: (itunesstats_read) Fixed error when reading
	  the Shuffle's stat file (0x18 was used as minimal record length
	  instead of decimal '18').

2006-02-03  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c, src/itdb_playlist.c, src/ithumb-writer.c:
	  removed nested-functions. Thanks to Brian Jackson for the patch
	  (he was not the only to send patches -- please, nobody feel
	  offended that I didn't act sooner).

2006-01-03  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/ipod-device.c: (ipod_device_set_property) check hal_context
	  before accessing it to avoid segfault when hald is not running.

	  freed if libhal_ctx_init() failed.

	  (ipod_device_get_model_index_from_table): fix warning about
	  unused computed value (thanks to Martin Aumueller)
	
2005-12-18  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/ipod-device.c: don't ignore return value of
	  fread/fwrite/ftell because of possible compiler warnings.

2005-12-11  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c: (itdb_thumb_get_gdk_pixbuf) allow to get
	  pixbuf even if no iPod is present if the thumbnail points to a
	  local filename. This way artwork support is also possible on the
	  'Local' repository in gtkpod (or any other application).

	* README: added quick HOWTO use libgpod

	* bumped version to 0.3.0 for release.

	* bumped version to 0.3.1 for CVS version.

2005-12-10  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	  (don't terminate the application just because the ArtworkDB was
	  manipulated).

	* src/itdb_artwork.c: change g_assert to g_return_if_fail
	  (don't terminate the application just because the ithmb file was
	  manipulated).
	
2005-12-05  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-artwork-writer/parser.c: Create ArtworkDB when it does
	  not exist.

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c, src/itdb_itunesdb.c,
	  src/itdb_track.c, src/ithumb-writer.c: handle artwork size and
	  count self-consistently.

	  better, take care of dbid2 a little better.

	* src/ithumb-writer.c: new ithumb_rearrange_thumbnail_file()
	  taking into account multiple references to the same slot.
	  ithumb-writer now cleans up 0 Byte files.

	
2005-11-30  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/db-artwork-parser.c: (parse_mhni): don't crash if
	ipod_image_new_from_mhni returns NULL

2005-11-28  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c: (unpack_RGB_565), (get_pixel_data):
	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: (get_mhod):
	* src/ithumb-writer.c: (pack_RGB_565),

	doing some mallocs to prevent potential int overflows in some mallocs
	which could be triggered by using forged iTunesDB files

2005-11-28  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	New API for thumbnail support: see src/itdb.h for details.

	* src/itdb.h: Introduced Itdb_Artwork and ItdbThumbType and

	* INSTALL:
	* autogen.sh:

	  make sure that libgpod actually works with 2.4...

2005-11-15  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: (itdb_new): initialise glib type system before
	calling ipod_device_new (which creates a gobject)

2005-11-13  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: when new rating is set on the iPod, backup

	  itdb_shuffle_write() to be identical to itdb_itunesdb_write()

2005-11-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* configure.ac: fixed hal detection, stole a bit more autoconf-fu from 
	libipoddevice so that ipod-device.c compiles when hal is detected

2005-11-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/hal-common.c:
	* src/hal-common.h: more #if => #ifdef changes

2005-11-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/ipod-device.c:
	* src/ipod-device.h: update comments to reflect the fact we are using
	#ifdef HAVE_LIBHAL instead of #if HAVE_LIBHAL now

2005-11-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/hal-common.c:
	* src/hal-common.h:
	* src/ipod-device.c: (ipod_device_set_property),
	(ipod_device_hal_initialize), (ipod_device_detect_volume_info),
	(ipod_device_new), (ipod_device_eject): sync with libipoddevice CVS,
	use #ifdef HAVE_LIBHAL instead of #if HAVE_LIBHAL

2005-11-06  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/ipod-device.h:
	* src/itdb.h: added missing G_BEGIN_DECLS and G_END_DECLS

2005-11-05  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_track.c: (is_video_ipod), (itdb_track_set_defaults): deal
	with unk208 differently on iPod video (it's used to indicate if the
	current track must be shown in the video or audio menu or both)

2005-11-05  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/ipod-device.c: (ipod_device_get_property),

	element to Itdb_iTunesDB. This makes it possible for libgpod to know
	the type (regular/nano/mini/video/...) of the iPod it's currently 
	dealing with (which is necessary for proper cover art support for 
	example)

2005-11-04  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: db-itunes-parser.h was missing from the source file

	  po/Makefile.in.in

2005-10-17  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/db-image-parser.c: (get_pixel_data),
	(ipod_image_new_from_mhni):
	* src/itdb.h:
