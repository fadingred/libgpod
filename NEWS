Overview of changes in libgpod 0.7.0
====================================

* support for iPod Nano 4th generation

This includes support for cover art.
Please note that this release DOES NOT support iPhones and iPod Touch
with firmware 2.x

* support for "sparse artwork" writing

This lets us write more compact artwork files to the iPod, which in turn makes
the UI more responsive (and saves disk space on the iPod).

* jump table support

These are the big letters that show up in the album/artist list when someone
quickly scrolls through them. Thanks a lot to Ian Stewart for implementing it.

* improved timezone handling

This should now work up to 5G iPods, for newer iPods, libgpod will assume 
timestamps are in UTC.

* translation updates

Thanks to all of our translators :)

* add mapping from iPod serial numbers to iPod models

The iPod serial number can be obtained programmatically, and its last 3 digits
are characteristic of an iPod (type, generation, color, capacity). libgpod
can now find out an iPod model using this serial number.

* much more complete API doc

Most (all ?) of the public API of libgpod is now documented with gtkdoc. Thanks
goes to Todd Zullinger.

* simplification of the cover art handling API

The API for artwork for developers using libgpod should be more
straightforward, if things are missing, don't hesitate to get in touch
with us ;)

* portability improvements to windows and macosx

This is probably not perfect yet, but the goal is to improve it as much as
possible so don't hesitate to send bug reports if some things are still not
working. Thanks to the songbird project and Eric Lassauge

* reworked handling of artwork formats

libgpod can now automatically use the artwork formats described in
SysInfoExtended even if the iPod model is unknown, this should make it possible
for libgpod to support artwork on newly released iPod models without the need
to upgrade.

* bug fixes and code cleanup all over the place


Overview of changes in libgpod 0.6.0
====================================

* support for iPod Classics and Video Nanos

The database from these models is protected by a checksum. When this checksum 
doesn't match the content of the iPod database, the iPod won't show any 
track (ie it will look empty). Support for writing this checksum has been 
implemented in this release thanks to the awesome work of a few people in
#gtkpod. However, to calculate this checksum, a so called "firewire ID" is 
needed which is different from iPod to iPod. Since reading it from the iPod
requires special permissions, the firewire ID must be written in a regular 
file on the iPod so that libgpod can find it and use it to generate the
checksum. 

libgpod installs a HAL callout to do that automatically when 
everything is installed in an appropriate place. It can also be done manually,
see README.SysInfo for more information.

Cover art should be working except for non square covers, preliminary photo 
support but this hasn't been widely tested yet.


* support for iPhone and iPod Touch

This requires manual user intervention: the devices must be jailbroken and 
mounted through sshfs. The iPod Touch also needs a firewire ID which must be
manually set, see README.SysInfo

Cover art is implemented but not tested at all, ditto for photo support on 
the iPod Touch


* additional tools to get the firewire id from new iPods including a HAL
  callout which will make the process totally automatic when it's properly 
  installed. These tools need libsgutils to be installed.

* endianness fixes in the artwork writing code
* now depends on glib 2.8 or newer

Huge thanks to wtbw and Simon Schulz without whom that release wouldn't have 
been possible. Thanks as well to the people on #gtkpod for the testing they 
provided.
